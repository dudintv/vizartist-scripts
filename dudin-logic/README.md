# Dudin Logic

An alternative to the standard Transition Logic system from Vizrt.

## Parts

* _Buffer_ - remembers the states of several elements and restores.
* _Control_ - makes the scene with lowerthirds manageable for preview in VCP.
* _Element_ â€” the main script! The logic of the operation of a single element.
* _Global_ - monitors and executes the logic of cross-elements logic.
