## Text file reader

This script recognizes data from text formatted as a table. By default, it splits text into rows by "new line". And, split to cells by "|" (vertical pipe).

Also, you can have "Front Matter" section in the beginning in the file. The script separates "Front Matter" from the data by one line with "---" (three or more hyphens).

Each line of "Front Matter" separates by ":", for example: "name: value".
