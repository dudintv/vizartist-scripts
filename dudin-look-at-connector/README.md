## Look-at and connector

Works like a standard "Look at" plugin but works with any container, and doesn't work with the camera.
It's possible to use this script as a subsitution for the standard "Connector". This script works even if you change the transformation the whole group â€” that happens very often and the standard "Connector" becames completely useless.

#### Version 1.0.1 (27 March 2022)
* fix: work with any transformation combinations acros parent containers

#### Version 1.0 (20 March 2022)
* "look-at": it can rotate the currect container in order to face to selected container
* you can choose X, Y or Z axis as the main axis (only in positive directions)
* it's possible to use this script as a subsitution for the standard "Connector":
* "strech efffect": you can scale current container in order to reach the atrget conatiner
* you can also scale current container by two secondary axes, or keep them equal 1
* you also can multiplay the strech effect (to accuratelly fix the length)
